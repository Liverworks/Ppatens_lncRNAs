### LncRNA expression prove using direct RNA Nanopore sequencing in Physcomitrium patens

Three protonemata and four gametophores samples were used. Sequencing quality control can be found in **qc_reports**. We used MinIONQC.R from https://github.com/roblanf/minion_qc for the quality control.
Guppy4.0.6 was used for basecalling. 
Full notebook can be found in **lncRNAs.ipynb**.
